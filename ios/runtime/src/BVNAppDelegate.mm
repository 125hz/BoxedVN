 *  The application delegate.
 *
 *  SDL's SDL_UIKitRunApp installs the class named by
 *  +[SDLUIKitDelegate getAppDelegateClassName].  SDL documents subclassing it
 *  and overriding that method in a category, which is exactly what happens
 *  here, so BoxedVN gets its own delegate without patching SDL.
 *
 *  The delegate owns one UIWindow for the SwiftUI library UI.  SDL creates a
 *  separate UIWindow of its own when a guest session starts.  Only one of the
 *  two is key and visible at a time, and BVNRuntime drives the swap through
 *  BVNFrontendShowLibrary / BVNFrontendHideLibrary.
 *
 *  The SwiftUI side is reached by name rather than by symbol, because the
 *  Swift application target links against this static library and not the
 *  other way round.  The frontend must declare:
 *
 *      @objc(BoxedVNFrontend) final class BoxedVNFrontend: NSObject {
 *          @objc static func makeRootViewController() -> UIViewController
 *      }

// created the library window - see the first line of
// -application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: below.  Without starting the
// log here first, every diagnostic from window creation (including a failed
// BoxedVNFrontend lookup, the most likely cause of a black screen) lands only
// in the in-memory ring and is never written to a file anyone can read.  The
// function is idempotent, so BVNGuestMain's later call is a harmless no-op.

// Objective-C class-method overrides only take effect for a message sent to
// the subclass (or an instance of it); a call site that names the base class
// explicitly, as this one does, always resolves against the base class's own
// method table no matter what subclasses exist. Overriding
// +getAppDelegateClassName inside @implementation BVNAppDelegate below is
// therefore invisible to this call site - without the category, SDL keeps
// instantiating its own plain SDLUIKitDelegate and BVNAppDelegate never runs.
//
// A category on SDLUIKitDelegate itself replaces its method table entry
// directly, which *does* affect every call site, including this one. This is
// exactly what SDL's own subclassing notice above +getAppDelegateClassName in
// SDL_uikitappdelegate.m asks for.
